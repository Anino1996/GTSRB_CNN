# GTSRB_CNN - EEN614 - Neural Networks Final Project

In this project, a system that can accurately detect and determine the type of road sign in a picture is implemented. A convolutional neural network is designed and trained using the GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset available on Kaggle with 43 different classes in order to be able to identify the type of road sign in a given image. 
A simple web application is then developed using the Streamlit library where an image can be uploaded and the corresponding type of road sign displayed. 
This web app was deployed using Heroku and can be found by visiting https://morning-anchorage-96843.herokuapp.com

The code and results obtained in building and training the model in question can be found in GTSRB_CNN_Results.pdf.
The code for the web application can be found in the "web_app" directory. 
"Report.pdf" is a comprehensive report describing the technical details of the project.
